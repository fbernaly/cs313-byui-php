            <h2>Welcome!!!</h2>
            <p class="content">My name is Francisco and I am majoring in Software Engineering at BYUI. I am from Mexico, but has been working abroad as a iOS Developer for the last 3 years. I have a wonderful family with 3 kids.</p>
            <p class="content">I think I have an amazing job that allow me (sometimes!!) to work from home, so I can spend more time with my wife and my kids. I do not try to abuse of that privilege too much. It is such a blessing to sit a the table with my family to have lunch. Other times it is quite a challenge especially when I have some work load and my kids want to play. They are super fun.</p>
            <p class="content">I really enjoy coding!!! I wish I started coding at an earlier age, but my first interactions with computers were around late 90's, just browsing the Internet and playing StarCraft. I was merely a consumer, not a producer.</p>
            <p class="content">I love hiking and bicycling with my family. We are planning of first camping ever as family. It will be an amazing expecience.</p>

            <p class="content">I am into Kendo, Japanese martial art with bamboo sword.</p>

            <p>One of my favourites quotes:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/03/formula-for-success?lang=eng"> "May I share with you a formula that in my judgment will help you and help me to journey well through mortality... First, fill your mind with truth; second, fill your life with service; and third, fill your heart with love."
